    <span>Album: Chromatica</span>
    <span>Año: 2020</span>
    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>I didn't ask for a free ride</p>
    <p> I only asked you to show me a real good time</p>
    <p> I never asked for the rainfall</p>
    <p> At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all</p>
    <p> It's coming down on me</p>
    <p> Water like misery</p>
    <p> It's coming down on me</p>
    <p> I'm ready, rain on me</p>
    <p> I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive</p>
    <p> Rain on me, rain, rain</p>
    <p> Rain on me, rain, rain</p>
    <p> I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive</p>
    <p> Rain on me, rain, rain</p>
    <p> Rain on me</p>
    <p> Rain on me</p>
    <p> Mmm, oh yeah, baby</p>
    <p> Rain on me</p>
    <p> Living in a world where no one's innocent</p>
    <p> Oh, but at least we try</p>
    <p> Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in</p>
    <p> So I don't lose my mind</p>
    <p> Baby, yeah</p>
    <p>(...)</p>
