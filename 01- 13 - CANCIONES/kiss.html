    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>You don't have to be beautiful</p>
    <p> To turn me on</p>
    <p> I just need your body, baby</p>
    <p> From dusk till dawn</p>
    <p> You don't need experience</p>
    <p> To turn me out</p>
    <p> You just leave it all up to me</p>
    <p> I'll show you what it's all about</p>
    <p> You don't have to be rich to be my girl</p>
    <p> You don't have to be cool to rule my world</p>
    <p> Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with</p>
    <p> I just want your extra time and your kiss</p>
    <p> You got to not talk dirty, baby</p>
    <p> If you wanna impress me</p>
    <p> You can't be too flirty, mama</p>
    <p> I know how to undress me</p>
    <p> Let me be your fantasy</p>
    <p> And maybe, you can be mine</p>
    <p> You just leave it all up to me</p>
    <p> We could have a good time</p>
    <p> You don't have to be rich to be my girl</p>
    <p> You don't have to be cool to rule my world</p>
    <p> Ain't no particular sign I'm more compatible with</p>
    <p> I just want your extra time and your kiss</p>
    <p> I think I'd better dance now</p>
    <p>(...)</p>
